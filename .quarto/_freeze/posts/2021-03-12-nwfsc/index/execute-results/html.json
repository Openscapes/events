Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. \n\n**This opportunity is funded and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).**\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NOAA_logo.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
