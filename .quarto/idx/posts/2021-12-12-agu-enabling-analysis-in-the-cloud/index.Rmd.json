These demonstrations will include science and applications user stories, and will highlight example workflows from the atmosphere, ocean, hydrology, cryosphere, and land disciplines. In addition, the workshop will highlight ESDS efforts in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and show how these techniques in novel applications can be applied to EOSDIS data. Participants will leave having a better understanding of how NASA Earthdata Cloud data and services can best be leveraged and integrated within their work across a variety of disciplines and data types.\n\nCome learn about ESDS’s strategic vision to develop and operate multiple components of EOSDIS in a commercial cloud environment and to support data users as they transition to cloud computing.
