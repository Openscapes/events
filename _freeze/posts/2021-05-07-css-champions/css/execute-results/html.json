We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This opportunity is funded by [**Code for Science and Society (CS&S)**](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/), whose event fund supports events that promote inclusion and broaden participation in open data science that drives scholarship. \n\n**Openscapes Champions** is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, as a cohort with your peers. Together, you will learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, through exploring open data science tools and community practices (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub). For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit [openscapes.org/champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/).\n\n### Cohort Details\n\nWe will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays in 2021.\n\n- **Dates:** May 7, May 21, June 4, June 18\n- **Times:** 9:30-11:00am PST \n- **Where:** remotely, via Zoom\n- **Who:** Cohort of 7 environmental research teams. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, lecturer, program manager, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (students, researchers, analysts, etc). \n- **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is sponsored by CS&S\n- **Expected time commitment:** In addition to 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, participants will meet independently to further discuss topics with their research group. The total expected time commitment is 5hrs/month for 2 months.\n\n### Nominate your team to participate\n\nNominate your team by filling out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8HfDy-5Bk2LRCSTeVgYFTtcSPga63pQemKoCO8F9TRg1NBA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by March 26, 2021.
