Where do we go next?**\n\nData driven science is ubiquitous at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), but data science efforts on campus remain largely siloed, leaving many on campus wondering “How do I fit in?” Find out where you fit among the data science practitioners, researchers, and educators from across campus. This summit will identify strategies for facilitating an interdisciplinary, collaborative future for data science at UCSB.\n\n",
