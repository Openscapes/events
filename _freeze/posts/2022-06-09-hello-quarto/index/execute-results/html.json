Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. What does it look like? How do you use it, what can it do? How does it compare to RMarkdown? What does it mean for Python and Jupyter Notebooks? What about for open science, reproducibility, interoperability, and publishing?\n\nFolks from [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) will share their experiences using Quarto to enable data-intensive open science in the cloud, in conversation with R-Ladies Santa Barbara. Following an hour of conversation, demoing, and community Q&A, we'll have another 20 minutes of informal chat and breakout rooms.\n\nThis event is co-hosted by [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) and [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSB).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](nasa-openscapes-rladies.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n",
