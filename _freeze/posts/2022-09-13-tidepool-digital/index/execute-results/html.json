Much of the data generated is not equally accessible to those who need it. Advancing access and reuse of data for public interest purposes requires **data collaboratives - new partnership models where data is made accessible and reciprocated** to generate insights that can help address societal challenges.\n\nCombining the expertise of The GovLab, and Openscapes, this Studio will help participants understand what data collaboratives are, and review their various manifestations; how to establish them in a methodological and purposeful manner; and to govern them in a responsible and effective way. The introduction will be accompanied by discussions to help participants build their skills and establish a community of practice with like-minded leaders around data collaboratives for the Blue Economy.\n\n[**The GovLab**](https://thegovlab.org/), an action research center founded at New York University, works to deepen our understanding of how to govern more effectively and legitimately through technology.\n\n[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.\n\n[**Intertidal Agency**](https://intertidal.agency/) designs at the intersection of people and planet and serves as the PI for the National Science Foundation's Convergence Accelerator grant that supports this work.\n\n\n## Details and registration\n\nWe are offering a single 1.5-hour Studio at two different times in September 2011:\n\n-   [**Studio A:** September 13, 11am -12:30 pm PT](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidepool-digital-data-sharing-studio-a-tickets-390849129267)\n\n-   [**Studio B:** September 15, 12pm -1:30 pm PT](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidepool-digital-data-sharing-studio-b-tickets-390853291717)\n\n-   **Where:** remotely\n\n-   **Who:** 15 Early Career Ocean Professionals in each Studio.
