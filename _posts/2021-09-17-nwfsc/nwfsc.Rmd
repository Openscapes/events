**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for marine research groups to explore open data science practices.**

**Openscapes **helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This opportunity is funded by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).

**Openscapes Champions** is a remote-by-design, cohort-based mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, as a cohort with your peers. Together, you will learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, through exploring open data science tools and community practices (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub). For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit [ openscapes.org/champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/).

**Program Overview:** We will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays in 2021.

* **Times: **11:00-12:30 pm PST 
* **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
* **Who: **Cohort of 7 NWFSC research groups. Each team consists of a team lead (PI, project lead, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (analysts, technicians, students, postdocs, etc).

* **Expected time commitment:** In addition to 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, participants will meet independently to further discuss topics with their research group. The minimum expected time commitment is 5 hrs/month for 2 months.
