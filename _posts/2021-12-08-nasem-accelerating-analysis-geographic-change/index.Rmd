Excerpt from the NASEM meeting webpage: 

> In this meeting, we will discuss ways to approach and leverage novel geospatial data, analytics and platforms to understand and assess rapid and profound geographic change. We will discuss the geospatial data science, infrastructure and resource challenges, focusing on human displacement, movement and migration due to sudden and dramatic physical and human events.
