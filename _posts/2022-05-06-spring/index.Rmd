## Program overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for environmental and Earth research groups to develop open data science practices.**

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapesâ€™ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact. 

**[Openscapes Champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.
