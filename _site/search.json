Where do we go next?\nData driven science is ubiquitous at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), but data science efforts on campus remain largely siloed, leaving many on campus wondering “How do I fit in?” Find out where you fit among the data science practitioners, researchers, and educators from across campus. This summit will identify strategies for facilitating an interdisciplinary, collaborative future for data science at UCSB."

Open science is an evolving paradigm that seeks to foster greater inclusivity, diversity, and participation in the scientific process while increasing transparency and reproducibility. In December of 2019, SMD released the Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024, which was partially based on the feedback from the 2018 data archives meeting. This strategy aims to enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. We want to take this opportunity to update the community on the progress of that Strategy as well to engage with you on the next steps of the implementation of the strategy."

We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science2, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nFishery Dependent Data (FDD) represent a complex mix of information collected to facilitate managing the region’s living marine resources. In the Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data are poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. Currently, FDD are therefore difficult to integrate into scientific advice for ecosystem based fisheries management. Analysts tend to be unfamiliar with the data or hesitant to explore their potential, and data can be viewed with skepticism rather than leveraged in new and innovative ways. There is a need to begin to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data to their full potential.\nThis opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and a grant from the Fisheries Information System Program through an award to UMass Dartmouth-SMAST through CINAR. It is coordinated by Gavin Fay (UMassD-SMAST), Andy Jones (NOAA NEFSC), and Rachel Baum (UMassD Claire T. Carney Library)."

We’ll cover considerations for open project design focused on inclusion, community building, web presence, and technology choices, sharing strategies from the NASA Openscapes Framework as an example. The NASA Openscapes Framework (https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) is supporting scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. Through the Openscapes approach, which builds on collaborative open design and software from open source communities, including Mozilla, RStudio, The Carpentries, and Pangeo, we are currently working with a cross-DAAC mentor community to co-create learning resources and strengthen empathy-centered teaching practices to empower research teams through this migration to the cloud. We are focusing on building community across teams through identifying common goals and developing shared processes while also developing technical skills for contributing, review, and teaching. This session will explore open project design and lessons learned thus far through the NASA Openscapes Framework while also providing practical strategies for participants."

By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nThis opportunity is funded in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)."

This opportunity is funded by The California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (COAST), which supports marine and coastal research by CSU faculty members and students.\nOpenscapes Champions is a cohort-based mentorship program that empowers science teams with open data science tools and grows the community of practice in the research group, institution, and beyond. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, as a cohort with your peers. Together, you will learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, through exploring open data science tools and community practices (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub). For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit openscapes.org/champions.\nCohort Overview: We will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays in 2021.\n\nDates: May 7, May 21, June 4, June 18\nTimes: 12:00-1:30pm PST\nWhere: remotely, via Zoom\nWho: Cohort of 7 CSU COAST research teams.

    "text": "CascadiaR Conference is a regional R conference for the Pacific Northwest on June 4-5 2021. Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst will be co-presenting a keynote talk on June 5. There is a great lineup of speakers and we are excited to be a part of it!\nSlides available at openscapes.org/media.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Open science as a movement and the art of Openscapes\nAbstract: The open science movement is “a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding” (Ramachandran et al 2021). We’ve felt included in this movement through the #rstats community, and argue that data science is a powerful entryway to welcome researchers to open science – one that transforms open science from an aspirational idea to a tangible daily benefit for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration. We will share how Openscapes is helping to onboard more research teams to the open science movement, in part through artwork to represent and develop ideas to make open science more inclusive and kind.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes @juliesquid is a marine data scientist and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). As founding director of Openscapes (created during her Mozilla Fellowship) she champions kinder, better science in less time and empowers science teams with skillsets and mindsets for open, reproducible research. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. She is a Carpentries instructor and co-founder of Eco-Data-Science and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\nAllison Horst @allison_horst is an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where she has been teaching environmental data science, math and data analysis courses since 2012. Through her artwork, Allison illustrates data science concepts, R packages and functions, workflows and mindsets to welcome and support R learners, and was RStudio’s Artist-in-Residence from 2019 - 2020. She co-founded and is an active member of the UCSB TidyTuesday coding club and R-Ladies Santa Barbara. She has also created all artwork for Openscapes and was a mentee in the inaugural Champions Cohort!"
