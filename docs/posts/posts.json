    "contents": "\nThis is a professional development and leadership opportunity for COAST-affiliated research groups to explore open data science practices.\nOpenscapes helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This opportunity is funded by The Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (COAST), which supports researchers and affiliates in the California State University system.\nOpenscapes Champions is a cohort-based mentorship program that empowers science teams with open data science tools and grows the community of practice in the research group, institution, and beyond. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, and learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, exploring open data science tools (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub) and learning with a cohort of peers. For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit openscapes.org/champions.\nProgram Overview: We will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays in 2021.\nDates: May 7, May 21, June 4, June 18\nTimes: 12:00-1:30pm PST\nWhere: remotely, via Zoom\nWho: Cohort of 7 COAST research teams. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty or PI) and up to 4 team members of your choice (graduate students, undergraduates, technicians, etc).\nExpected time commitment: In addition to 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, teams will meet to share and practice concepts with their full research group. The total expected time commitment is 5hrs/month over two months.\nNominate your team to participate\nNominate your team by filling out this Google Form by March 26, 2021. This opportunity is open only to those affiliated with CSU COAST. Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty or principal investigator). We will confirm participation by early April 2021.\n\n\n\n\nThis opportunity is funded by COAST. \n\n\n\n",
