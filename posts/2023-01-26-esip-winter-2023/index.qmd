Building from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, this session will bring together a diverse set of leaders from across the U.S. government to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning with Openscapes. We will share stories, examples, and concrete tips for supporting each other and our colleagues with collaborative, inclusive open science approaches, with the aim of strengthening channels for inter- and cross-agency learning in the Year of Open Science 2023.

How to prepare for this session: Read [our blog post from our 2022 session](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/02/17/esip-winter-2022/).
